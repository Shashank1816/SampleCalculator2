Certainly! Here's the refactored code with added comments:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import "./styles.css";
import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");

// Function to render the app
const renderApp = () => {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
      <App />
    </React.StrictMode>,
    rootElement
  );
};

// Function to handle rendering errors
const handleRenderError = (error) => {
  console.error("An error occurred while rendering the app:", error);
};

// Add an event listener for errors during rendering
window.addEventListener("error", handleRenderError);

// Render the app
renderApp();
```

In this refactored code, I have added comments to explain the purpose of each section:

- The `import` statements are used to import the necessary dependencies for the code.
- The `rootElement` variable is used to store the DOM element where the app will be rendered.
- The `renderApp` function is responsible for rendering the app component using `ReactDOM.render()`.
- The `handleRenderError` function is used to handle any errors that occur during rendering and log them to the console.
- The `window.addEventListener()` method is used to add an event listener for errors during rendering, which will trigger the `handleRenderError` function.
- Finally, the `renderApp` function is called to render the app.

These comments provide a clear understanding of the purpose and functionality of each section of the code.
