Certainly! Here's the refactored code with the aim of modularization:

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");

const renderReactApp = () => {
  try {
    ReactDOM.render(
      <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
      </React.StrictMode>,
      rootElement
    );
  } catch (error) {
    handleError(error);
  }
  
  window.addEventListener("error", handleError);
};

const handleError = (error) => {
  console.error("An error occurred while rendering the app:", error);
};

renderReactApp();


In this refactored code, the main focus is on modularity and separation of concerns. The code is organized into separate functions for rendering the React app and handling errors. The `renderReactApp` function is responsible for rendering the app using `ReactDOM.render`, while the `handleError` function is responsible for logging any errors that occur during rendering.

By separating these concerns into separate functions, the code becomes more modular and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle. This makes it easier to understand, maintain, and test the code.
